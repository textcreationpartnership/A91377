            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not unknowne to all the world, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Inhabitants in and about the Citie of London, with what deſperate and fame-wounding aſperſions my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the integritie of my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God, my King, and my Countrey, hath been invaded by the malice and furie of Malignants, and ill-affected perſons to the good of the Common-wealth. Some charging mee to have beene the Promoter and Patronizer of all the innovations, which have been obtruded upon the Eccleſiaſticall government of the Church of England. Others, of more ſpitefull and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant ſpirits, alleaging that I only have been the man, who hath begot and foſtered all the ſo lamented diſtractions, which are now rife in this Kingdome. And though ſuch calumnies are ever more harmfull to the authors, than to thoſe whom they ſtrive to wound with them, when they arrive only to the cenſure of judicious perſons, who can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh formes, and ſee the difference betwixt truth and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111433:3"/>
falſhood; yet becauſe the ſcandals inflicted upon my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, have been obvious to people of all conditions, many of which may entertaine a beliefe of thoſe reproachfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, though in mine owne ſoule I am far above thoſe ignominies, and ſo was once reſolved to have waived them, as unworthy my notice; yet at laſt, for the aſſertion of my integritie, I concluded to declare my ſelfe in this matter, that all the world, but ſuch as will not be convinc'd, either by reaſon or truth, may heare teſtimony of mine inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. To paſſe by therefore the Earle of Straffords buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in which ſome have been ſo impudent, as to charge me of too much partialitie and malice, I ſhall declare my ſelfe fully concerning the reſt of their aſperſions: namely, that I have promoted and fomented the differences and ſchiſmes now abounding in the Engliſh Church.</p>
            <p>How unlikely this is, and improbable, ſhall to everie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man be quickly rendred perſpicuous: for that I am, and ever was, and ſo will dye a faithfull ſon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, without having the leaſt relation in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe to thoſe groſſe errours of Anabaptiſme, Browniſme, and the like, everie man that hath any acquaintance with my converſation can beare mee righteous witneſſe. Theſe being but aſperſions caſt upon me by ſome of the diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Clergie, and their Fautors and Abettors, becauſe they might perhaps conceive, that I had been a maine inſtrument in extenuating the haughtie power and ambitious pride of the Biſhops and Prelates; which if I had been (as I only delivered my opinion, as a member of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) that attempt or action of mine had been juſtifiable both to God and a good conſcience, and had no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded me guiltie of revolt from the Orthodox Doctrine of the Church of England, becauſe I ſought a reformation of ſome groſſe abuſes crept into its government, by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and perverſneſſe of the Biſhops and their Subſtitutes. For was it not high time to ſeek to regulate their power, who in ſtead of looking to the cure of mens ſoules (which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111433:3"/>
is their genuine office) they inflicted puniſhments on mens bodies, baniſhing them to remote and deſolate places; after ſtigmatizing their faces, only for the teſtimony of a good conſcience. When not contented with thoſe inſufferable inſolencies, they ſought to bring in unheard of Canons into the Church, Arminian, or Papiſticall Ceremonies, whether you pleaſe to terme them, there is not much difference; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing burdens upon mens conſciences, which they were not able to beare, and introducing the old aboliſhed ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of bowing to the Altar: and if it ſavoured either of Browniſme, or Anabaptiſme, to endevour to ſuppreſſe the growth of thoſe Romiſh errours, I appeale to any equall minded Proteſtant, either for my Judge and witneſſe. Nay, had the attemprs of the Biſhops deſiſted here, tollerable they had been, and their power not ſo much queſtioned as ſince it hath been. For which they ſaw, the Honourable, the High Court of Parliament, begun to look into their enormities and abuſes, beholding how they wreſted Religion like a waxen noſe, to the furtherance of their ambitious purpoſes: then Troy was taken in, then they began to deſpaire of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any longer their uſurped authoritie; and therefore as much as in them lay, both by publike declamations and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate councels, they laboured to foment the civill differences betweene his Majeſtie and his Parliament, abetting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Malignants with large ſupplyes of men and money, and ſtirring up the people to tumults by their ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sermons. Surely then no man can account me an ill ſon of the Common-wealth, if I delivered my opinion, and paſsed my vote freely for their aboliſhment, which may by the ſame equitie be put in practice by this Parliament, as the diſsolution of Monaſteries, and their laſie Inhabitants, Monks and Friars were in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time: for without diſpute, they carried as much reputation in the Kingdome then, as Biſhops have done in it ſince, and yet a Parliament then had power to put them downe; why then ſhould not a Parliament have power to do the like to theſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111433:4"/>
everie way guiltie of as many offences againſt the State as the former? For mine own part I atteſt, God Almightie the knower of all hearts, that neither envie, or any private grudge to all, or any of the Biſhops, hath made me adverſe to their function; but meerly my zeale to Religion and Gods cauſe, which I perceived to be trampled under foot, by the too extended authoritie of the Prelates, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the puritie of their inſtitution, ſhould have beene men of upright hearts and humble minds, ſhearing their flocks, and not flaying them, when it is evident they were the quite contrarie.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome will alleage, it is no good argument to diſſolve the function of Biſhops, becauſe ſome Biſhops are vicious: to that I anſwer, Since the vice of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops was derivative from the authoritie of their function, it is verie fitting the function which is the cauſe thereof be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and its authoritie deveſted of its borrowed feathers: otherwiſe it is impoſſible, but the ſame power which made theſe preſent Biſhops (ſhould the Epiſcopall and Prelaticall Dignitie continue in its ancient height and vigour) ſo proud and arrogant, would infuſe the ſame vices into their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours.</p>
            <p>But this is but a mole-hill to that mountaine of ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reports that have been inflicted on my integritie to his Sacred Majeſtie: ſome boldly averring me for the author of the preſent diſtractions between His Majeſtie and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, when I take God, and all that know my procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, to be my Vouchers; that I neither directly, nor indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, ever had a thought tending to the leaſt diſobedience, or diſloyaltie to His Majeſtie, whom I acknowledge my lawfull king and Soveraigne, and would expend my bloud as ſoone in his ſervice, as any Subject he hath. 'Tis true, when I perceived my life aimed at, and heard my ſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a Traytour, meerly for my entireneſſe of hearrt to the ſervice of my Countrey, was enformed that I, with ſome other honourable and worthy Members of the Parliament,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111433:4"/>
were againſt the privileges thereof demanded, even in the Parliament Houſe by His Majeſtie, attended by a multitude of men at armes, and Malignants; who I verily beleeve had for ſome ill ends of their owne, perſwaded His Majeſtie to that exceſſe of rigour againſt us, when for mine owne part, (my conſcience is to mee a thouſand witneſſes in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe) I never harboured a thought, which tended to any diſ-ſervice to His Majeſtie, nor ever had an intention preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the State: when I ſay, notwithſtanding mine owne innocence, I ſaw my ſelfe in ſuch apparent danger, no man will think mee blame-worthy, in that I took a care of mine owne ſafetie, and fled for refuge to the protection of the Parliament, which making my caſe their owne, not only purged me and the reſt, of the guilt of treaſon; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſecured our lives from the ſtorme that was ready to burſt out upon them. And if this hath been the occaſion, that hath withdrawne His Majeſtie from his Parliament, ſurely the fault can no way be imputed to mee, or any proceeding of mine, which never went further, neithe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſince His Majeſtie, nor before then, ſo far as they were warranted by the known Lawes of the Land and authorized by the indiſputable and undeniable power of the Parliament, and ſo long as I am ſecure in mine owne conſcience that this is truth, I account my ſelfe above all their calumnies and falſhoods, which ſhall returne upon themſelves, and not wound my reputation in good and impartiall mens opinions.</p>
            <p>But in that devilliſh conſpiracie of <hi>Cataline</hi> againſt the State and Senate of Rome, none among the Senators was ſo obnoxious to the envie of the Conſpirators, or liable to their traducements, as that great Orator and Patriot of his Countrey, <hi>Cicero;</hi> becauſe by his counſell and zeale to the Common-wealth, their plot for the ruine thereof was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and prevented; though I will not be ſo arrogant, to parallel my ſelfe with that Worthy, yet my caſe (if we may compare leſſer things with great) hath to his a verie neere reſemblance, the cauſe that I am ſo much maligned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111433:5"/>
by ill-affected perſons being, becauſe I have beene forward in advancing the affaires of the Kingdome, and have been taken notice of for that forwardneſſe: they out of their malice, converting that to a vice, which without boaſt be it ſpoken, I eſteeme as my principall vertue, my care to the Publike Utilitie. And ſince it is for that cauſe, that I ſuffer theſe ſcandals, I ſhall endure them with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hoping that God in his great mercie will at laſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile His Majeſtie to his High Court of Parliament, and then I doubt not but to give His Royall Selfe, though he be much incenſed againſt mee, a ſufficient account of my integritie. In the interim, I hope the world will beleeve, that I am not the firſt innocent man that hath been injured; and ſo will ſuſpend their further cenſures of me.</p>
